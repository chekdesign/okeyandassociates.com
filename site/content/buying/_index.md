    text: "Since we work primarily by referral, our team looks at the agent-client relationship completely differently. We want to help you find the right home for you — not the “quickest to close” home or the “highest commission” home. Finding the right home can be tough. The path between beginning your search and getting the keys at settlement can be long and tricky. There are many variables to consider on this road: How much home can you afford? What fees do you pay and when? How much should you offer?  What do you do if you are competing with other offers? What steps can you take to protect yourself during this process and while under contract? So, we streamline the process for you"
