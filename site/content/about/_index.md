    title: About Us
  - text: >-
      We are a rare breed of real estate agents - we work primarily by referral,
      so the dynamic of our relationship with clients is fundamentally
      different. Many agents only care about one transaction - since we want to
      be your realtors for life, we strive to blow you away with such incredible
      service that youâ€™ll tell your friends and associates about us and be
      advocates for us. As a buyer, we want to help you find the right home, and
      as a seller, we want to help you get the highest sales price possible. We
      are top-rated and have an amazing family of clients and advocates thanks
      to our unique style of work!
