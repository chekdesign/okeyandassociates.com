  - title: Why Choose Us?
    text: "We are a totally different breed of real estate agents - we work primarily by referral, so the dynamic of our relationship with clients is different. Many agents only care about one transaction - since we want to be your realtors for life, we strive to blow you away with such incredible service that youâ€™ll tell your friends and associates about us and be advocates for us. As a buyer, we want to help you find the right home, and as a seller, we want to help you get the highest sales price possible. We are top-rated thanks to this unique style of work."
